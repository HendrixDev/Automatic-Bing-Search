# Automatic Bing Search

**Does not work with accounts that have 2 factor authentication**

In appsettings.json add user objects to BingUsers array as you have to do searches with as well as updating each search count value. Update the SignIn URL, and if it does not have enough time to fill in the forms with your internet speed increase the SleepTime to what works best for you.
